A-Chan: "Welcome to the first lesson of Alpha Academy!"
A-Chan: "In this lesson you will learn about your first spell in Swift!"
A-Chan: "For any magician that is learning a new programming language, the first spell they will have to master is the ‘print' function spell!"
A-Chan: "‘print’ is super simple to use, all you have to do is to type the code below:"
Code: "print(“Hello, World!”)"
Console: "Hello, World!"
A-Chan: "The code above is a complete program that can print out the ‘String’ “Hello, World!” onto the console!"
A-Chan: "A ‘String’ is a data type used in swift to store text that will be used in the program, a ‘String’ should always start and end with double quotation marks!"
A-Chan: "Well-done! You have just mastered your very first spell in swift!"
